Normalcy bias, or normality bias, is a cognitive bias which leads people to disbelieve or minimize threat warnings. This results in denial of the possibility of a natural disasters no matter how many warnings are flashed. 70% of people usually operate under the mindset that everything is going to be fine, and nothing bad is really going to happen during a potential danger.

Indeed, life is not like a movie. In a situation of danger like a Tsunami or a shooting, everyone will not be running and escaping from the danger. A lot of people would stay paralised and would deny the reality.

Nowadays we have a clear example of Normalcy bias with the COVID19 outbreak. Even though everyone knew from the beginning about the high level of infection of the virus and the danger of a global pandemic, most political and business leaders seemed to ignore the possibility of global pandemic event and pretend that it is just a "seasonal flu".
