Today is Eid el Fitr, a celebration that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan during which Muslim people have to fast from sunrise to sunset.

This Ramadan was a bit special for me. It's the first one in my life where I felt lonely fasting. In the past, I was used to breaking fast with my family or with cherished friends in the mosque when I lived in Toulouse or in Belgium.

This year I woke up for suhoor on my own, without a parent to drag me out of bed. Also, it was the first time where I had to think everyday about finding the time to make food for iftar (dinner after sunset).
Usually in Ramadan there would be something prepared for you. Sure you might help out in the preparation but itâ€™s not completely up to you.

The big change this year was due to the coronavirus:

There are some mosques in Houston, but because of social distancing the traditional and savory feast hosted at the mosque was not an option this year.

Paradoxically, the only times when I felt less alone was when Karla: a non-religious girl that I met in Houston decided to join and fast with me some days.

My conclusion is that the Ramadan definitely does not have the same flavor when isolated from family, friends, and other people who fast Ramadan. It gets really hard at times.

In the meantime, this Ramadan made me understand that it is less about friends and family. It is more about my spiritual convictions and building a stronger connection to my religion. In the end, that is exactly what should matter anyway.
