Today is Eid el Fitr, a celebration that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan during which Muslim people have to fast from sunrise to sunset.

This Ramadan was a bit special for me. It's the first one in my life where I feel lonely fasting. In the past, I was always used to break the fast with my family or with some other people in the mosque when I lived in Toulouse or in Belgium.

This year I had to wake up for suhoor on my own without a parent to drag me out of bed. Also, it was the first time where I had to think everyday about finding the time to make food for iftar.
Usually in Ramadan there will be something prepared for you. Sure you might help out in the preparation but itâ€™s not completely on you.

Also the big change this year was due to the coronavirus:

There are some mosques in Houston, but because of social distancing the delicious spread of food every night at the mosque was not an option this year.

Paradoxically, the only times when I felt less alone was when Karla: a non religious girl that I met in Houston decided to join and fast with me some days.

My conclusion is that the Ramadan definitely does not have the same flavor when isolated from family, friends and other people who fast Ramadan. It feels really hard sometimes.
In the meantime, this Ramadan made me understand that it is less about friends and family. It is more about my spiritual convictions, and building my connection to my religion. In the end, that is exactly what should matter anyway.
