As an engineer in Machine learning and HPC (high performance computing), I have always been fascinated about the use of these technology to improve human life. Today I would like to talk about the role of supercomputers in the fight against COVID19.


Supercomputers are powerful machines that are made of hundreds and in some cases thousands of processing units. Such computers have a very large storage capacity and provide high-speed computation.

To rapidly advance scientific research for treatments, the White House announced the launch of the COVID19 HPC Consortium. This Consortium includes industry and academic leaders in the field of HPC such as IBM, AWS, Nvidiq, MIT, Argonne National Laboratory, etc ...

For COVID19, supercomputers are being used to identify drug compounds that can neutralize the virus. Several simulations have been made to improve our knowledge on the interaction between the human cells and the protein strain of the virus.
Those simulations are essential to be able to simulate the virus behavior at the molecular level and thus contribute to the development of new treatments and preventive measures.

For the moment, researchers have been able to isolate 77 small molecule compounds from more than 8000 initial molecules. The 77 resulting molecule compounds are likely to make the virus harmless for the host cell.
