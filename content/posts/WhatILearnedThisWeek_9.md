This week was an intense week. In collaboration with 2 of my coworkers Denis and Mauricio, we decided to publish an abstract for a Geoscientist conference: [EAGE](https://www.eage.org/en). 
This journey started last week when my coworker Denis told me about this article that he would like to write about our work. 
I was very glad to hear about this opportunity to publish our work. 
This joy became a challenge when he told me that we had only one week left before the deadline.
It was an insane rush to make it happen.
We had to collect all our findings and plots presenting the results put them in a concise abstract of 4 pages.
We worked very hard and we finally made it.
From this experience I learnt a lot in the rigor aspect thanks to Mauricio who reviewed 2 times very carefully the content of the abstract.
In our abstract, we are investigating HPC scaling strategies for a semantic segmentation model applied to Geophysics images.   

I'll update you in the future to talk about the outcome of the submit.
