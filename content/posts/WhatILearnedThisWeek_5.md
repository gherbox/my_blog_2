Like a lot of people, I was very intrigued by these rich kids drop shipping millionaire videos on YouTube. How could they make this amount of money? Is it luck? Is Dropshiping really working?


Like usual, when something catches my attention, I want to get the bottom of it. That is why I decided to do dropshipping by myself.

Some of you are probably wondering : "What is dropshipping?"

Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesnâ€™t stock the products. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. As a result, the merchant never sees or handles the product.

I followed the most common methods explained by some famous Dropshippers which consist in:

1) Finding a product (often using aliexpress)

2) Creating a shop online thanks to Shopify

3) Creating a Facebook ad campaign to promote the product

I followed those three main points carefully, and here is the result: https://kinesidesk.com/

I thought that a laptop desk to improve the posture would be a success, especially during this period of lockdown.

For the moment my online store has not been very lucrative, I got only one sale. But I will keep working on it. I still think that is a very interesting way to generate passive incomes.
