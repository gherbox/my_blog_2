This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I love learning. As a research engineer I have to always learn and experiment new things.
Learning is fun and crucial for your career in a number of ways.
What is also about learning is that you can share your knowledge with others.
One of the various ways to share your knowledge is writing.
Sometimes weeks can go by without any discernible progress. Writing a weekly post is a small, but important achievement which reminds me that I learn new things everyday, even if I can’t always bring them to fruition as quickly as I would like.

To take the plunge, I decided to start a new challenge:
The What I Learned This Week Challenge. I will post every sunday about something that I learned during the week. I will be writing about something new that I learned or that happened in my life.

This post was just a presentation of the challenge. I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future :)

See you next week!!
