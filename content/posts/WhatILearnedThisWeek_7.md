This week was marked by the waves of protests which have shaken the US and the world following the death of George Floyd.
George Floyd was a black man who was killed during an arrest by Derek Chauvin, a police officer. 
The police officer knelt on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, even though George Floyd repeatedly said "I can't breathe" in his final moments.
A bystanderâ€™s video of the incident was captured and shared through the Social Network. This footage led to a week of crowds burning with grief of anger, frustration, sadness.

The protests were very virulent, overall in the city of Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. People were protesting against police brutality and racism against black people behind the slogan 'black lives matter'.

I personally don't want to debate on whether the Police is racist or not. I think this tragedy is horrible and that police officers should be more trained before starting their job.
It would make the society safer and avoid other police blunders.
