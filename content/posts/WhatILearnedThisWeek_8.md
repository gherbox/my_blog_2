This weekend was my first time camping in the US, I went camping in the NorthWest Texas.
I went there with 2 American girls (Karla & Ivana) and 2 French girls (Julie & Morgane).
We spent a really nice weekend there together.

Sure the lack of experience, made us make some common first mistakes.
For instance, on Friday we went for a long hiking in Caprock Canyon, under a blazing sun without enough water. We had no water after one or two miles hiking whereas we had to walk 6 more miles.
It was very difficult, and a bit scary because at some points we were lost. 

But believe me, the beauty and the uniqueness of the place is worth every second spend there.
I saw for the first time some bison. I found myself face to face in front of this herd of huge bison. They stood still and stared at me for a long time. I was paralyzed. I thought that they would charge toward me if I made any sudden movement.
Finally, after 15min they decided to move. I felt relieved.

The day after we went to a place called Cadillac Ranch which is a place where you can find dozens of Cadillac nailed to the ground vertically. It is the best place to let express your art by spray painting on those cars. It's also a great place to take photo for Instagram. My friends, for example, took the exact same photo at least 100 times to make their lifestyle look enviable with a flattering pose.

The last day, we hiked in Palo Duro, which is an awesome place. This was my favorite place. The landscapes are breathtaking.
The best way to enjoy this place is definitely to camp there and wake up with the sunrise in the morning and enjoying the orange sky.
I definitely loved this place, and this weekend . I wish I could visit more places like that during my stay in the US.
