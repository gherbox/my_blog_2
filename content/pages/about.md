I am a HPC - Machine Learning enginner at Total. Prior to working with Total, I worked as a data scientist for AXA: a multinational insurance company.

I completed my Master of Science in France at INP Enseeiht with a focus in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

My current interest remains in using HPC to accelerate deep Neural Network training and scale out on multi GPUs.

In my free time I enjoy running and travelling the world.
