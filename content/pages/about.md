I am a HPC - Machine Learning enginner at Total . Prior to Total, I worked as a data scientist for the insurance company Axa.
I completed my Master of Science in France at INP Enseeiht with a focus on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

My current interest remains in using HPC to accelerate deep Neural Network training training and scale out on multi GPUs.

In my free time I enjoy running and travelling the world.
